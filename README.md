# custom-shell
UNIX Shell written in Lex/Yacc for input parsing and C++ for internal logic.
## Getting Started
Clone all of the files in this repository (must have Lex and Yacc installed as shown below) and then run `make` to build the shell. Then, run `./shell` to switch control to the custom shell. To exit, run `exit` within the custom shell.

To install Lex: `sudo apt install flex`

To install Yacc: `sudo apt install bison`
